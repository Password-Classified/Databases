# Dummy SQL Databases

This is a collection of dummy SQLite3 databases, for learning and practicing SQL querying, generated with the VS Code extension **Generate Data** by Markus KÃ¶ppen (@mkoeppen). Find it [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkoeppen.generate-data) or use the VS Code extension ID <kbd>mkoeppen.generate-data</kbd>.

They are generated with the Python SQLite3 module and you will find the data in the _Data_ folder, and the code for generation in the _Generated_ folder.

### Databases

Bear in mind that none of this is real data, just made up with a dummy data generator. Don't try to use it for ML models or anything as such.
